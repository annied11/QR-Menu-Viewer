## Features
- Generate QR codes linked to menu pages.
- Organize menu items into categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts, beverages).
- Display menu data in a clean and responsive web interface.
- Simulates a real-world digital restaurant setup.
- Separate views for the main menu and the kitchen.
